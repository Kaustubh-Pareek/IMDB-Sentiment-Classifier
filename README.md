# 🎬 IMDB Sentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

This repository provides a complete solution to perform Sentiment Analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

The project includes:
* 📦 **Model building and training** using TensorFlow/Keras
* 🧠 **Preprocessing and padding** of input text
* 🌐 An interactive **Streamlit web app** for live sentiment prediction
* 📊 **Binary classification** (Positive / Negative Sentiment)

## 📚 Dataset

The IMDB dataset used here is a preprocessed binary sentiment dataset built into keras.datasets.imdb.

- Contains 50,000 movie reviews (25k train + 25k test)
- Encoded as sequences of word indices
- Each review is labeled as 0 (negative) or 1 (positive)

## ✨ Key Features

- Simple and interpretable RNN architecture
- Clean and modular implementation
- Interactive UI with real-time predictions
- Easily extendable to LSTM/GRU models
